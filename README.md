## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App.

## Algorithm:
Select 2–3 competing apps/websites from the same domain. Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria. Explore each app and observe its UI, navigation, performance, and interactions. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations for each app. Compare all apps based on usability, clarity, personalization, and design. Propose improvements and redesign concepts to fix usability issues. Create a hybrid redesigned interface combining the best features of all apps. Validate changes using A/B testing by comparing original vs redesigned versions. Summarize results and conclude the improvements in user experience.
