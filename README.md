## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App.

## Algorithm:
Select 2–3 competing apps/websites from the same domain. Use Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics as the evaluation criteria. Explore each app and observe its UI, navigation, performance, and interactions. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and heuristic violations for each app. Compare all apps based on usability, clarity, personalization, and design. Propose improvements and redesign concepts to fix usability issues. Create a hybrid redesigned interface combining the best features of all apps. Validate changes using A/B testing by comparing original vs redesigned versions. Summarize results and conclude the improvements in user experience.

## Output:

## Result:
The heuristic evaluation and redesigned interface demonstrated that combining the strengths of Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Music—while addressing their weaknesses—can significantly enhance overall user experience. The proposed design improves navigation clarity, personalization accuracy, and interface minimalism, leading to a more balanced and user-friendly music streaming platform.
